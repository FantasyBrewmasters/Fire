This is the first of a Fire and Ice series of beer from Fantasy Brewmasters.

The Recipe
====
Inspiration: Goya Ginger Beer

Desired output:
light, crisp, refreshing
fiery - delayed, spreading down the throat
minimal lemon flavor
not overly sweet

questions:
dark or light beer > leaning towards light, but a vibrant red finish would be interesting
should rice be used in this one to keep it super light
yeast, what style yeast would set this off?

Test:
1) amount of ginger to get fire. use extract or fresh, or combination
2) white sugar to grain replacement - use rice?
3) brown sugar to grain replacement
4) red coloring malts
